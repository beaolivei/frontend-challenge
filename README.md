This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Goal

This little Single Page Application Project was developed for the FinCompare HR Process. 
The challenge was to collect data from Ergast API on Formula 1 results from 2005 to 2015, pointing out which one was the World Champion for each year. 

### Steps for Creation

As a first step, I developed a concept, understanding what information I wanted to display and what was the right look to it. The prototype can be seen in the page: https://www.figma.com/file/JAsPXp9VP3ksH3auXASs2nRk/Formula1_FinCompare?node-id=9%3A3.

I separted the components and tryed to imagine the best way in which I could re-use them in the pages.

Unfortunatelly, I just had one day to do the development because I need to hand-in my final thesis manuscript in the begging of next week and I had to solve many problems with my database for that research.
When I began I believed I would have more time available. I had a completly different strategy to make the API requests and use the data in a more efficient way, but considering the time constrain I opted for a solution that would deliver a working product. Because of the short time I had, I also did not follow exactly what I planned in terms of design and component destribution. My focus was on checking the exercise boxes and delivering something that works and can be understandable, even though I can think of many ways to improve this SPA. 

The steps were: 
1. Understanding the goal: what was essential to show in the application?
2. Designing the application structure: what were the components and what were the pages? 
3. Designing a layout, so that once I started the coding I wouldn't have to keep on thinking on colors and other things of the sort. The prototype can be seen in this page: https://www.figma.com/file/JAsPXp9VP3ksH3auXASs2nRk/Formula1_FinCompare?node-id=9%3A3
4. Understanding the API documentation 
5.Creating "Create React App"
6. Creating the folder's organization 
7. Installing the packages I was gonna use (in this case, React-Router and styled.components)
8. Coding (really really fast in this case)
9. I am really attentive with page responsiveness but I couldn't do a really responsive page here, so it is worth saying that the website is for laptop dimensions. In the first page ('/'), I made it almost responsive, in order to show you that I know how to work with the media queries, flex-box and all this cool CSS things.

### How to run it
If you download the folder in your computer I would recommend running it in the local server. 
I also deployed a version of it in Netilifly. You can check it at frontendchallengebeaoliveira.netlify.com
